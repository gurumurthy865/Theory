sft + ctr + down	-->move statement downwards

DUPLICATE AND DELETE LINE:
ctr + D		-->Duplicates the line
ctr + delete		--> Deletes line

VIEW PARAMETER INFORMATION:
ctrl + P		-->Moving the cursor out of method signature removes intellisense, when curosr bought back this command helps to see suggestion

COMMENTING AND BLOCK COMMENTING CODE:
ctrl + /		--> select lines and execute shortcut for individual line comment
alt + ctrl + /	--> to comment blocl of code

FOLDING AND EXPANDING CODE:
ctr + -		--> the method on which cursor is kept will be collapsed
ctr + +		--> to expand the collapsed code

NAVIGATING TO CLASS:
ctr + [ --> search in the moveable window
ctr + O --> other way to open the same moveable window
ctr + alt + <	--> to navigate back to the class
ctr + N		--> to navigate to a class

NAVIGATING TO SYMBOLS:
ctr + alt + O 	--> lets say we need to find Employee.getName() shows in movable window
CamelHump.getName like E.getName	--> to filter name by class name

NAVIGATING TO FILE:
ctr + sft + O --> type slash at the end to find the folders ex:resource/

NAVIGATING TO ACTION:
sft + ctr + A	 --> type theme
sft + ctr + A	-->to change the java compiler type compiler

NAVIGATING BETWEEN TABS:
sft + ctr + A --> type placement and select none; now all tab's willb e gone
ctr + E		--> it brings up the recent used files;press arrow key to the file required and press enter;you can type and serach too

EXTENDING AND SHRINKING SELECTION:
         	--> selects one complet string;two times arrow selects two string of a line
					 keep pressing it selects whole block;then whole method;then whole class;
ctr + W		--> to extend selection
sht + ctr + W	--> to shrink the selection					 

CODE COMPLETION:
sft + ctrl + space --> shows suggestions to completion
					   same inside method parameter bracker also works
sft + ctrl + space(twice) --> pressing the above command twice gives static method suggestion instead of simple suggestions
ctr + space(twice) -->(static method suggstion list) asserSame is a method and you dont know which class it belongs type and use command, it gives all static class
alt + enter		-->static import

POSTFIX COMPLETION:
ctrl + J --> Stirng s; s. gives normal suggestion; when you press this command and select if gives if condition for null pointer exception
			similarly you can create syncronized block,forloop,try block etc
ctr + alt + A --> type postfix and you can see all postfix completion templates

GENERATING STUB TEST,SETUP and TEARDOWN METHOD:
 ctr + insert 	-->select testMethod;insteading of typing @Test manually and a methodname
				in generate menu, you can select setup method,teardown methods as well in a test class

VERSION CONTROL:
ctr + K	-->
ctr + D
ctr + alt + Z
ctr + v --> all version options

REFORMAT:
alt + ctr + L -->to format whole class;select text to format certain method
