oauth:outh2 type of secutruy,, auth server and  resource server..... based on user auth server token is issued,,, resource server identifies token and check if user has access to resourc e
JWT token:subject,roles,client id,client secret,,, ms to generate a token,when user and passwoed is passed it authenticated role sub ,client id all set to that toaken
                  when sent to ms , those token is verifed comparing subject,roles ,,,,

outh dependency added,, property added,,, 
you should give a static key whenever app is started,,, or you can add in property key
everytime you call an api that key should ve passed compulsarily



ureka server; id service discovery
zuul gateway:a builiding, gatewat,, you have 100 ms,, you have to go through gateway... all aouth JWT are written in zulu gateway
                      RMI:ms service registered to eureka server,, to do that you need to create ureka server which is also a sprigboot project along with a dependency
                             neflix 

1 auth server,1 ureka server,1 zulu gateway are connected
when loggined in first goes to auth server to check credential and generate tokem which sent to gateway. 
in gateway token is verfied in zulu and on success of verification we will have a configuration written,, a list of services
it asks ureka server if particular service is available, if yes then proceeds



1 eureka server,, 1 config file,,zulu api gatewat
application will be running in main port,, suppose we have installed in three four servers
api gaeteway has an url,application url and 

app registreed to ureka server,,,,

does RestFullAPI's Required Serialization?
serialization

can you Tell me Simple API how you will Write?
spring initializer,,,, spring.io ,,,  thorugh web
through springboot
cli command


use transient to avoid serialization...
synchronozed:say you reading application.properties,,, deadlock when two resoucres access at same time
use sync to avoid deadlock

service locatior?

fter developing, null pointyer comes, takes required input and debug
why microservice is not discovered

@async

API gateway:


jobs are running at backgroyup ,100 ppl
100 thread has to run
have define, Runnable interface, resource sharing
callable,,, stored in memory,,, when limit reached rogram start executing
class implements by callable
lacal variable, constructor,, 
in callblae some method are there , call method where we take object and do the job and return the thingd

user comes,user at a time execurtes 100jobs,,
at a time 5 tasks should execute,, this is executer servie

when you initializw a obj, threadpool execut
executor obj, executor.will give some methods,,,, say, executor.threadpoolsize
when you dont know how many will run,,,, so when user request thread keep on creating



bus concept,, is used ,, so whenever you change property,, without stopping service ,, things are automatically picked
