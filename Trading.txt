Dividends
Issued in the form of shares
It is not mandatory for the company to give dividends
Say google gives 5% ie.say 5$,, if you reinvesting it in FD return might be 2-3% which is very less;so they only try to reinvest and not give dividends
now dividends are taxable
is 100% dividends possible?yes but what 100%? market value?hell no dividends is on face value
if face value of company say MRF is 10RS and they give 100% dividends then they will you 10rs for each share you hold


Face Value:Original price at which shraes were brought by promoters who started the company
           there can be multiple promoters
		   Every company(promoters) decide what is the face value
		   

LTCG->long term capital gain;more than one year investment;tax free till 2.5L;


Britania                                 2014		2015	2016		
  TurnOver(top line growth)              6348 		 7269	7881
  Profit before tax						  543		883		1149
  Profit after tax(bottom line growth)	  370 		662		763	
  share price on 31st march				  843		277		2686

currently britania share market value is around 4000 which is less compared by last year, did market fall No
no, they did stock split, ie. when share value is 8000, they double the no of shares bringing each share value down by 50% ie. 4000. in such scenario the face value will be down from 2RS to 1RS
the moment stock splits, face value is also halved

MoneyControl:
if anything to be seached about a company go for money control
Closing price:the price at which shared has closed today.. ie. LTP latest traded price(LTP changes every second, we are talking about LTP at 3 30) , ie. share value at 3:30PM
Previous close: price at which yesterday share has closed

Pre market session:at 9 15 whn open many would be restless and make lot of bid,, that would flctuate the market value up to 3 within first 15 min which is huge
		   this was causing loss to small investors, so new segment started between 9 to 9:15 which is called pre opening market session;time during which you are able to palce buy or sell.
		   say in those 15 min, for first 7 min many bids go, in next 3-4 minutes orders but sell will be matched and in last 3 min you get to know the trend of the market
there is also a session between 3 30 to 4 which is not for retail investors like us but for brokers
after market hours:4PM to 9AM,, can we place order during these hours,,? yes we can. 
		   
open price:will be equal to previous close ideally but 99 this is not true;depending upon after market investment the open price value varies
Gap up opening: if share is 100rs closing and open at 101rs
Gap down opening: if share is 100rs opening and opens at 99rs
UNCH: unchanges which is a very rare scenario where opens at same price

there will be slight change in share value between 3 30 to 4PM

Bid price(Qty)=26;this means 26 people wants to but the share
offer price(Qty)=40;no of people who wants to sell share
volume:99224 ie. no of shares that chagned hands
       always you should check the volume over 2 days,5days,30days
	   
Todays low high;
52 weeks low high->max and min price reached in last one year

Coporate action in money control:
gives deatils of annual meeting;bonus,splits, dividends issued;board meeting;etc

Bonus: bonus 8:25 means you get 8 bonus shares for every 25 shares you held
		announcement data->day on which bonus announced;record data;ex bonus(excluding bonus) date which is 2 days less than recorded date{2 working days excluded holiday)
		you will be entitleted to avail bonus even after announcement date, if announce made data is june 1st and recorded date which will be always greater is august 1st
		say share price is 100rs and bonus of 1:1 is declared share price will become half after ex bounus date  ;ex bonus date is a date on which share start trading on revised price
		issues bonus brings down the share value and  attracts investment ;bonus is alternative to dividends and also used by cash crunch companies that wants to pay dividends
		
Three stock exchanges of india:
NSE
BSE
MSEI:also know as MCE multi commodity exchange
		
members of exchange: in local word brokers
retails investors does not recognize retail investors,so we need to trade through its members like zerodha

Investors:RII->retail individul investors(less than 2L rs in IPO)	;HNI ->High networth individual; DII->Domestic institutional investor(banks/LIC etc);FII/FPI->foreign protfoli investors
helps during ipo, like RII segment HNI segment allotment etc	

tading T+2 days; after 2days we get shares in our account or the money when sold

then we have clearing houses which take care of movement of shares ie. from whom to whom stock moves. ex: National securities clearing coproration ltd takes care of NSE;ICCL takes care of BSE

Depositories and DP's:NSDL adn CDSL are depositories who materalize and dematiralize shares
today since patanjali not listed,its shares is in physical format; company when listed wants to dematerialize then it goes to depository
DP's depository parties: Brokers
ours accounts indirectly opened with depositories

Does company knows who buys and sells shares?
Depository will have all the list;there is a mandatory disclouse that if an investor holding shares more than 5% they should disclouse it else SEBI takes actions

IPO:
when ipo is alloted, its not through BSE or NSE but through primary market.. in primary market company sells you share
then it comes to secondary market on listed day, where you cannot sell back to company but traded between investors in secondary market


Trade date: the day you traded share
Settlement date: date on which amount /share is depsoited
Traded date + 2 days = settlement date
STT:security transaction charge which is mandatory
There will be GST on brokerage charg3 which is 18%


MIS account/INTRADAY:
Margin intraday settlement
here we buy and sell on same day
ie. Short selling; sell high and when it goes low then buy
various brokets square off at differnt time, say 3 10 some at 3:20PM like zerodha..

Upper circuit: All buyers and no sellers
say you are bearish and  sold 100 shares which you did not have at 150rs and when trying to sell at lower price to make profit
 but  when shares are traded in upper circuit ie. say stock prices goes above 150 ie. ended at cloing price 170rs ,share auction(done by brokers between 3 30 and 4 ) comes into picture where they buy shares behalf of you at whatever the price available and you incur loss

financial instruments are the assets that can be traded; ex: shares ,debenture, bonds are such assets where FD is not
financial instrument is a real or virtual document representing a legal agreement involving the monetory value
Lets say you start a cofee shop and your profits/loss depends on price on milk,, say we can say milk is the underlying asset
or say price of sugar is derived from sugarcane availability

Trend:each high is known as PEAK or TOP and each down as Trough or Bottom
     Types of trends
		Uptrends we keep getting higher top and higher bottom in every cycle;market will be bullish;(Jyothi4 higher trend)
		Downtrend :each top is lower thatn than previous top so does bottom.;here supply is more than demand; you should withdraw when downtrend starts
		Sideways trends: horizonatal trend and there is little movement; we should not trend during this time; at best we can buy at bottom and sell at top
    Trend within a trend:
	    Secular trend:lasted for last 5 to 10 years; major trends are more than 1 year best for investors;intermediate tredn between 1 -3 months for postion traders;minor trends less than one month(Jyothi5 trade within trade)
		
4 Stages of stock market:
satge 1: consolidated stage ie. after continous trend market consolidates and starts gaining. this is a good point to enter
stage 2: signifies breakout form market;stage2 is most attractive stage and majority money made here which is public participation stage;longer uptrend losts more invertor enter
stage 3:again consolidated and starts dropping but here buyer and seller are same where we should get ready to sell ,its a distrubution phase;here market breaksdown or sometime start another uptrend rarely(Jyothi6 trade staging)
        accumulation phase which is flat,, then upwardTrend, then EXCESS UPWARDTREND which is danger as there will be sudden fall of high volume;a sharp reversal then a consolidation phase(flat);distrubution phase and starting of downward trend;again accumulation and upward trend(Jyothi7 trade staging)
		
Time framing: when anlysing chart it is important;if you choosing time frame for one day ,or 1 hour or 1 month etc 
            choosing timeframe depends on what kind of trading you are doing
	Intraday->few minutes to few hours(prefer 15 minute chart)
	Scaliping->few seconds to few minutes
	postional trding-->who hold threre positon overnight, it can be 2 days to few months
	   in that intermediate from weeks to months and then short term few days to few weeks
	Long term investments-->months to years; to deterimine exist point chart is necessry here;for long term our charts should be weekly chart
	

How to read current trend:
for intraday, look at 15 min chart
for positon , look at daily chart over few months
for long, look at weekly chart over years
